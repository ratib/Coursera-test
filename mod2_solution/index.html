				<h3 id="pink">Chicken</h3>
				<p>This tasty noodle dish is the same one my mom used to make for me when I was growing up. It's definitely comfort food. You can alter it with adding your favorite meats and veggies.</p>

			<div class="food">
				<h3 id="red">Beef</h3>
				<p>Just like my Korean mom makes it! It's delicious! Even better if rolled up in red leaf lettuce with rice and hot pepper paste. If you want to spice it up just add red pepper powder to your marinade.</p>

				<h3 id="yellow">Sushi</h3>
				<p>This is Japanese girl's festival food. This sushi is wrapped in very thin egg sheets. Inside is a vinegar rice ball. I used an Italian parsley sprig as the tie. The look is so cute!</p>
